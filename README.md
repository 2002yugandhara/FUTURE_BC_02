I explored real-world crypto platforms that offer free airdrops and rewards for completing simple tasks. Platforms like PublicAI, MagicNewton, Shaga, and Gradient Network helped me understand how Web3 missions, wallet integration, and token incentives work. I connected my MetaMask wallet, created profiles, built AI assistants, and completed quests to earn points or XP.
